The game features GPT-powered characters, each with their own unique personalities and responses. Players must use their charm and wit to impress these characters, with the AI deciding their dating fate based on their text interactions.


The game was developed using Unity, with all the programming done in C#. Our team integrated OpenAI's GPT models with a modified version of the OpenAI Unity open source project to create realistic and dynamic character interactions, giving each virtual character a unique personality.
