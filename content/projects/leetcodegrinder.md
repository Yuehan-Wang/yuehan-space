Leetcode Grinder, developed by me in 2023, is a Chrome extension tailored for software engineers and problem solvers. It enhances productivity by tracking time spent on Leetcode and related sites. Its key feature is limiting website access before one have spent enough time Leetcoding, promoting efficient and focused learning sessions. 


This tool is especially useful for those preparing for coding interviews or improving their programming skills. Leetcode Grinder exemplifies my skills in creating user-centric software solutions and demonstrates my passion for technology and coding education.
